# Environmental/Wastewater Projects:

## Project 1: Calculating the Limit of Stokesian Settling in Wastewater
-	Built a new system for quantifying the minimum concentration of wastewater solids at which sedimentation in settling tanks cause poor water quality. Also known as Limit of Stokesian Settling (LOSS) 
- Designed a unique R algorithm to convert 100â€™s of images of settling wastewater (in 2-liter jars) to color indexes in order to analyze light penetration through the jar
- Implemented 3 mathematical models in R to process color indexes based on regression analysis, sigmoid fitting and mean deviation of light through the jar
