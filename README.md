# Environmental/Wastewater Projects:

## [Project 1: Calculating the Limit of Stokesian Settling in Wastewater](https://github.com/OlaOlagunju/LOSS_Project)
-	Built a new system for quantifying the minimum concentration of wastewater solids at which sedimentation in settling tanks cause poor water quality. Also known as Limit of Stokesian Settling (LOSS) 
- Designed a unique R algorithm to convert 100’s of images of settling wastewater (in 2-liter jars) to color indexes in order to analyze light penetration through the jar
- Implemented 3 mathematical models in R to process color indexes based on regression analysis, sigmoid fitting and mean deviation of light through the jar

## [Project 2: Using the Oxygen Uptake Rate of Biomass as a Control Parameter in Wastewater Treatment](https://github.com/OlaOlagunju/OUR_Project)
- Built automated system to continuously (1 hr. cycles) analyze microbial activity in wastewater via Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) respirometry and operate PLC’s for pump and sensor I/O
- Implemented C++ algorithms to control microbial wasting, water, aeration, Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) tuning, based on a target OUR range.
- Developed R algorithms code to analyze the hourly data
- Led daily laboratory research experiments to assess wastewater quality from the pilot and the plant’s mainstream channels
- Championed a novel way to increase energy recovery in secondary wastewater treatment by 30% while targeting a specific microbial activity under variable influent and temperature conditions in a year
