# Ola's Portfolio

# Environmental/Wastewater Projects:

## [Project 1: Calculating the Limit of Stokesian Settling in Wastewater](https://github.com/OlaOlagunju/LOSS_Project)
-	Built a new system for quantifying the minimum concentration of wastewater solids at which sedimentation in settling tanks cause poor water quality. Also known as Limit of Stokesian Settling (LOSS) 
- Designed a unique R algorithm to convert 100’s of images of settling wastewater (in 2-liter jars) to color indexes in order to analyze light penetration through the jar
- Implemented 3 mathematical models in R to process color indexes based on regression analysis, sigmoid fitting and mean deviation of light through the jar

## [Project 2: Using the Oxygen Uptake Rate of Biomass as a Control Parameter in Wastewater Treatment](https://github.com/OlaOlagunju/OUR_Project)
- Built automated system to continuously (1 hr. cycles) analyze microbial activity in wastewater via Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) respirometry and operate PLC’s for pump and sensor I/O
- Implemented C++ algorithms to control microbial wasting, water, aeration, Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) tuning, based on a target OUR range.
- Developed R algorithms code to analyze the hourly data
- Led daily laboratory research experiments to assess wastewater quality from the pilot and the plant’s mainstream channels
- Championed a novel way to increase energy recovery in secondary wastewater treatment by 36% while targeting a specific microbial activity under variable influent and temperature conditions in a year

# Business Data Projects:
## [Project 3: Data Analysis using SQL to guide Business decisions for Chinook](https://github.com/OlaOlagunju/SQL_Business_Project)
- Explored a SQLite database and collected data to find out: top music genres sold in USA, music sales performance by country, employees sales performance, album vs individual track sales and popularity of tracks in the store
- Proposed that bringing in Rock bands should be the next business venture as they garnered over 50% of tracks sold
- Advocated to expand marketing efforts in India, due to the large population (over 1.3 billion) and one of the highest customer average lifetime purchases ($91.58)
